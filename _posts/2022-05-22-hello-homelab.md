# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my homelab docs site!

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Depending on the values of $R_1$ and $R_2$, the voltage at the mid point will
be different. Lucky for us, it is very intuitive. If $R_1$ and $R_2$ are equal,
that means half the resistance is above the midpoint and half the resistance is
below the midpoint. In that case, by the time we travel halfway along the full
resistance (all the way to the midpoint), half the voltage will be gone. So the
voltage at the midpoint would be $\frac{V_{dd}}{2}$. If instead $R_1$ was 1% of
$R$, then the voltage at the midpoint would be 99% of $V_{dd}$ because only 1%
of the voltage drop has occurred by the time we travel 1% of the way across the
total resistance.
